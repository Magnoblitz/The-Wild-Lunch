![The Wild Lunch title screen](art/title_screen_display.png)

This project was made in Godot from March 2025 to June 2025.

This repository has all of my code and assets from the project (except for the art since there are way too many files), but if you want to just download the playable exe you can get it from my itch.io page: https://magnoblitz.itch.io/the-wild-lunch

In the game you manage a western saloon. Discover new food and drinks to serve your customers, but watch out for outlaws!
